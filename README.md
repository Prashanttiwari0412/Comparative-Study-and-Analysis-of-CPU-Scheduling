# Comparative-Study-and-Analysis-of-CPU-Scheduling
This project deals with the comparative study of different CPU scheduling
algorithms and their implementation on the working of smart grocery stores
(Reducing waiting time of customers in the waiting queue and increasing profit
of the company).
Scheduling of processes is carried out to finish the work on time. The project deals with the comparative study of different CPU scheduling algorithms and their implementation on the working of smart grocery store.
The problem that arises in scheduling the tasks is utmost waiting time, If any Customer is there with one product still he/she may have to wait for other Customers to finish up Billing Process . So Can we implement any  Algorithm which can solve  real world problems like smart grocery store efficiently?
